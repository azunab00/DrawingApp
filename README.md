This is a C# WPF application created for a college project. The application has some very basic Paint operations like drawing a line, a rectangle, a circle and 
ellipse as well as choosing a color to draw, changing line thickness or even erasing what has been drawn. By clicking on File->New, you can open a new tab and name it. You can close the tab or save your work as a .bmp image.

Bellow is a screenshot of what the application looks like:
